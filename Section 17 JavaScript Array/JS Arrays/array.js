// Data Structure is simply a collection of data
// Arrays are our first data structure!

// Arrays - Ordered Collection of Values
// - List of comments on IG post, - Collection of Levels in a game, - song in a playlist

// With JavaScript Arrays can be whatever you want a empty, string, number, and a mixed array unlike other programming languages.

// you make a array with a variabele like let or const, Example let students = [] //

//Array have individial index and it starts of 0 ; each element in an array has a correspondng index.

// Length is always one greater than the maximum index.

// Push - add to the end
// Pop - remove from the end
// Shift - remove from the start
// Unshift - add to the start

// More Array Methonds Below :

// concat() Method is sued to merge two or more arrays. Thi methods does not change the existing arrayss, but instead creates a new one
// includes - look for a value
// indexOf just like a string.indexOf
// join -creates a string from an array
// reverse - reverses an array
// slice - copies a portion of an array
// splice - removes/replaces elements
// sort - sorts an array.

// Double equals and triple equals are just going to check for the reference in memory for arrays

// const can be change only if the content has brackets. const = [sadsada] <-- stuff inside can be changed cant lose the brackets though.
