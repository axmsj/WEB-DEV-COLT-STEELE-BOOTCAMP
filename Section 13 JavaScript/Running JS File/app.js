// Open DevTools on chrome and click the console to be able to see the code. You need to put console.log (basically the same as print in python) and then a () with a single quote to be able to see your script in the console chrome dev tools.

// I have added a console.log shortcut which is CTRL + SHIFT + L .... console.log('');
console.log('Hello');
